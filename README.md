# alarm-notification
Part 1 is a rasberry pi 3 home notification system wired. Use the scripts with cables connecting to magnetic switches and you get a text
when ever the switch is brought to an open state. Part 2- I plan on doing a wireless version, at this day in age I wouldn't attemp wiring
my apartment. So part 2 will include 433 Mhz magnetic switches when I get to that.
